README for dataset SYNTHETIC


=== Usage ===

This folder contains the following comma separated text files 
(replace DS by the name of the dataset):

n = total number of nodes
m = total number of edges
N = number of graphs

(1) 	DS_A.txt (m lines) 
	sparse (block diagonal) adjacency matrix for all graphs,
	each line corresponds to (row, col) resp. (node_id, node_id)

(2) 	DS_graph_indicator.txt (n lines)
	column vector of graph identifiers for all nodes of all graphs,
	the value in the i-th line is the graph_id of the node with node_id i

(3) 	DS_graph_labels.txt (N lines) 
	class labels for all graphs in the dataset,
	the value in the i-th line is the class label of the graph with graph_id i

(4) 	DS_node_labels.txt (n lines)
	column vector of node labels,
	the value in the i-th line corresponds to the node with node_id i

There are OPTIONAL files if the respective information is available:

(5) 	DS_edge_labels.txt (m lines; same size as DS_A_sparse.txt)
	labels for the edges in DS_A_sparse.txt 

(6) 	DS_edge_attributes.txt (m lines; same size as DS_A.txt)
	attributes for the edges in DS_A.txt 

(7) 	DS_node_attributes.txt (n lines) 
	matrix of node attributes,
	the comma seperated values in the i-th line is the attribute vector of the node with node_id i

(8) 	DS_graph_attributes.txt (N lines) 
	regression values for all graphs in the dataset,
	the value in the i-th line is the attribute of the graph with graph_id i


=== Description === 

SYNTHETIC is a set of synthetic graphs based on a random graph G
with 100 nodes and 196 edges, whose nodes are endowed with normally distributed scalar attributes
sampled from N (0, 1). Two classes A and B each with 150 attributed graphs were generated from
G by permuting node attributes. Each graph in A was generated by permuting 10 node attributes, 
and each graph in B was generated by permuting 5 node attributes, after which noise from 
N (0, 0.452) was added to every node attribute in every graph.
